"""
Regression tests for CancellationService's affiliate-commission voiding.

Bug: approving a cancellation (wallet/refund/no-refund) marked the
meal_plan_day/deliveries rows cancelled but never touched the linked
`payment.commission_amount` — so a cancelled order kept counting toward
the affiliate's earned/owed balance in
AffiliateService.get_affiliate_commission_summary forever.

No real Supabase connection is used — `CancellationService.sb` is replaced
with an in-memory fake that returns pre-canned responses per table and
records every call, so these run offline via:

    python -m unittest tests.test_cancellation_service -v

(run from the mealplanner-flask/ directory)
