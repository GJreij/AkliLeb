    2. Kcal deviation is soft-penalised in the objective AND hard-bounded by

    3. Protein, carbs, and fat each have their own hard band (macro_tol)

       single-meal path (macro_hard_bounds=False), macro accuracy is
       "best-fit" via the objective only, UNLESS protein_hard_bound=True —
       in that case protein alone gets a hard band while carbs/fat stay
       best-fit, so kcal + protein both land within tolerance and only
       carbs/fat float freely.

    4. Meal-type distribution caps are relative to total_K (not fixed kcal_t).

    5. strict_culinary=True  → STRICT culinary constraint set (Pass 1).
       strict_culinary=False → RELAXED culinary constraint set (Pass 2).
       Macro hard-bands are identical in both passes.

    6. skip_balance=True drops the main-vs-non-main ordering constraint
       (used on single-meal days, where that ordering is what causes
       structural infeasibility) but NEVER the main-vs-main MAIN_RATIO
       bound between two mains sharing a meal — that check stops one main
       from dominating another and has nothing to do with the single-meal
       infeasibility problem skip_balance exists to solve.

    Returns None if the LP is infeasible or non-optimal.

                  (today's target gets nudged down); negative means UNDER

    carryover_fraction : how much of the cumulative deviation to fold in

    max_adjust_pct : safety cap — the adjusted target is clamped to within

    optimize_subrecipes for that day (i.e. the adjusted_target if carryover
    was applied), and `day_totals` is the third tuple element returned by
    optimize_subrecipes (contains protein/carbs/fat/kcal actuals).

    Skips updating a key if day_totals' tolerance_used indicates the greedy
    fallback path with no numeric totals, but in practice protein/carbs/fat/
    kcal are always present and numeric in day_totals, so this is mainly a
    defensive guard.
